# B.A.E. (Aluminum and Glass Supply)
B.A.E. Web-Based Inventory System.

## Background
B.A.E. (Aluminum and Glass Supply) started in January 28, 1997. This Supply Store deals in supplying simple fixtures such as sliding windows and doors, casements, magnetic and glass slides, etc. and steel works like gates, doors and grills, in Buhay na Tubig, Imus, Cavite.

## Technical Information
This web-based inventory system requires PHP 5 and MySQL. Old PHP and MySQL versions were used as it was the only version that came with USBWebServer. Compatibility with PHP 7 or newer was not yet tested. 

Web Frameworks such as Materialize CSS, W3 CSS and JQuery were used in this project.

## Project Information
Created on October 24-30, 2017 by Andresito de Guzman and Kevin Mendoza at De La Salle University Dasmarinas, Philippines as a requirement for System Analysis and Design (SAD) SY 2017-2018.

## Repository Information
This repository is created to serve as a backup repository and reference for future projects. The software is provided without warranty.

## Security Information and Issues
This system's security should be upgraded before deploying in production. Care in user input through validation and sanitation among other security techniques like password hashing and salting was made to secure the site. These may not be enough as there were known security lapses like SQL injection, cannot be ruled out on time as the development was rushed. Preparing SQL queries must be made to ensure that the system would not be vulnerable.
